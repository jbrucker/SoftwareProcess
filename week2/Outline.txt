## Week 2

Questions from last week?

1. Objectives 
   * understand how to create a basic project plan and work breakdown structure.
   * introduce estimation

2. Topics

   Project Planning:
   * project should have a written scope statement, with clear goals
   * project should have a WBS
   * define objective measures of progress

   McConnell 'Rapid Development'
   * recommended by Martin Fowler (UMLD, chapter 2)
   * some passages to share:
   4 Dimensions of Software Development:
   People
   Process
   Product
   Technology
   for rapid development, you have remove impediments and maximize benefits
   in each dimension.

Question: which dimension has greatest potential impact on development speed?
Answer: people.  Factor of 10 difference in individual programmers,
factor of 5 in team speed. "People" factors you can influence:
- staff selection (p. 13)
- team organization. Tailor to match project size, product attributes, schedule
- motivation

Question: which dimension has 2nd biggest impact of development speed?
Answer: process
Factors you can influence via process: p. 15-16

Efficient Development: figure on page 19.
Apply _practices_ in 4 key areas (pillars)
  1) avoid classic mistakes
  2) development fundamentals (best practices for analysis, design, contruction, integration, and testing). Section 4.2.
  3) risk management - 
  4) schedule-oriented practices

Classic Mistakes (chapter 3) - divided among the 4 dimensions

3. Homework
  * How will your track and record your time and effort?
  * Early project planning is often very inaccurate.  Requirements or design
    of solution are unknown, actual work differs from original plan.
    * Why do early planning (plan-based approach or predictive planning)?
  * 

4. Lab Activity

5. Reading

* SE9 (Sommerville), ch. 23 Project Planning,
* TSP, ch. 6 Development Planning.
* PMBOK, section 8.2 on Project Planning (high level description).
* RUP Software Develop Plan template.  This is the template for your project.
