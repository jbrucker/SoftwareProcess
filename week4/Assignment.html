<h2>Work Products Due Next Week (Sep 15)</h2>

<p>
These documents should be in your CM system.
Please give read/write access to me (jebrucker@gmail.com) and Sarun (mapfaps@gmail.com, sarun.w@ku.th).
</p>
<p>
These documents should not contain any spelling or punctuation errors, and very few grammar errors.
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Deadline:</b> I will grade documents based on the latest version in CM
as of Tuesday, 9:00. Any changes after that won't count for this week.
<br/>
Evaluation based on the document in the folder named in your <b>CM Plan</b>.
</blockquote>

<dl>
<dt>CM Plan</dt>
<dd>
	If your team got score &lt; 10 on the CM plan last week, then revise it, improve it,
	and have other team members review it.
</dd>
<dt>Vision</dt>
<dd>
	If your team got score &lt; 10 on the Vision last week, then revise it, improve it,
	and have entire team review it.
</dd>
<dt>Better WAR Templates</dt>
<dd>
	All teams need a better form or template for the individual and team weekly report.
</dd>
<dt>SRS draft, including Use Cases</dt>
<dd>
	SRS should contain fairly complete set of UC in brief form,
	important non-functional requirements, important assumptions, and scope.  
    The SRS should be reviewed for accuracy of content and English.
</dd>
<dt>Software Development Plan</dt>
<dd>
	The SDP should be updated and contain a fairly complete <b>schedule</b>.
	The schedule should include iterations (with dates), with all major work assigned to iterations.
	<ul>
	<li>Major work includes design, implementation of all UC, system testing,
	and documentation.
	<li>Each feature will be tested in the same iteration that it is implemented,
    so you don't need to separate development and testing of one feature in the schedule.
	<li>
    Complex UC can be implemented in parts ("slices"), which may span more than
	one iteration.
	</ul>
	Creating a schedule is the only way to know if you can finish in the available time.
	Be specific, realistic, and honest in your project schedule.
<dd>
<dt>Iteration Plan</dt>
<dd>
	A detailed iteration plan for this iteration. It should be more detailed than
	the iteration plans in Software Spec &amp; Design.
	<ol>
	<li>List the work to be done in this iteration and the week in which each task
        will be done.
		<br/>
		<em>Who</em> will perform each task will be specified in your weekly plan,
        so you don't need to specify it in the Iteration Plan.  However, you can
        assign work in the Iteration Plan if you want, to aid scheduling.
        "Who" can be a person, role, or group of people working on a component.
	<li>For development and testing work, write the estimated time to complete each one.
		(Estimating time is a check whether your weekly plan is realistic.)
	<li>Include verifiable milestones for each week. You should also have at least 
        one overall goal for the iteration.
	<li>List any major risks or issues to be addressed in the iteration.  Training to
	gain proficiency in a framework you will use is an example.
	<li>
		Include any other significant info about what you plan to achieve this iteration.
	</ol>
</dd>
<dt>Week Plan for 14-20 Sep</dt>
<dd>
A plan for this week that lists the work to be done:
<ol>
<li>List major tasks, who will do them, and estimated time.
<li>Also list support tasks done by CM, PMC, and PPQA, and weekly team meeting.
<li>Milestones for this week.
</ol>
The weekly plan somewhat duplicates info in the Iteration Plan. 
In the future we may modify the format.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> We (the class) need to agree which day a "week" starts and ends.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Oral Reports</h2>

<p>
This week each tean will report as follows:
<ul>
<li>
<b>PMC</b> - summary of team activity for the past week. This info is in the team WAR,
so you don't need to create a separate presentation.
	<ol>
	<li>Time worked by each team member and brief summary of what he/she worked on.
	<li>Work products created.
	<li>Any milestones achieved or missed.
	<li>Any significant problems.
	</ol>
<li>
<b>Team Leader</b> highlight and answer questions about your plan for this week.
This info is in the week plan, so you don't need to create a presentation document.
	<ol>
	<li>Planned work for the coming week.
	<li>Any significant risks or issues to address, and how you will address them.
	<li>Goals for this week.
	</ol>
<li>
<b>PPQA</b> describe activities done this week to assess quality of work products
and process.  Give any suggestions for improving processes.
</ul>

<h2>In Lab</h2>

<ol>
<li>
If your team is planning some development work for this iteration,
present and explain your goal and preliminary design, if you have one.
<li>
Review and Q&amp;A of documents you submitted this week.
<li>
Practice related to material covered this week.
</ol>
