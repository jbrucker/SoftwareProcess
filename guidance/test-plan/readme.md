The IEEE 829 test plan contains too much superfluous information (typical IEEE standard document).  You can get some testing concepts from it and the included example, but don't use it as a template.

Test plan should be concise, specific, and easy to update. Use tables for test cases and refer tests to requirements.

A test manager at Google wrote the [10 Minute Test Plan](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2011/09/10-minute-test-plan.html) on the [Google Testing Blog](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/), where is comments that verbose test plans are "dead" because they aren't actually followed.

He required his team to write a test plan in 10 minutes. It forced  them to eliminate unnecessary stuff from the plans. They never finished in 10 minutes, but finished 80% in 30 minutes, and a usable plan in 1 hour. (Used to require a day or longer.)

In rapid test planning, the team tended to focus on testing 3 things:
1. **Attributes** the adverbs and adjectives that describe characteristics of the system, such as "fast", "secure", or "accessible".
1. **Components** the nouns that define major code components such as classes or modules.
1. **Capabilities** verbs that describe user actions and activities.
