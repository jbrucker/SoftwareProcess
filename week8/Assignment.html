<h2>Individual Assignment</h2>

	Create 4 questions with answers for process-related knowledge 
    that software engineering students (and software engineers) should know.
    <b>At least 2</b> of the questions should be related to your role

<p>
    Guidelines for questions and answers:

	<li>
		Questions don't have to be complicated, but preferrably be something
		that demonstrates understanding of good software practices and/or
		good project management.
	</li>
	<li>
		A question can be given as a scenario, asking what to do in a given
		project context or to analyse some context.
	</li>
	<li>
		For each question, include a clear answer. 
		You may also include additional explanation of the answer.
	</li>
	<li>
		For each question provide a <b>reference</b> for additional information.
		Reference can be a URL, an article, or a book.  For articles and books,
		state precisely where to find the information, e.g.
		<blockquote>
		Jalote, <em>Software Project Management in Practice</em>, section 6.3.
		</blockquote>
