1. Q: What is PDCA cycle? And where tester work should be involved in? (Ref: http://www.careerride.com/Testing-what-is-PDCA-cycle.aspx)
A: PDCA is a four step problem solving process
   1. P - Plan (Devise your Plan)
   2. D – Do (or Execute) the Plan
   3. C – Check (Check the Results)
   4. A - Act (Take the necessary action)
   These process can be adapted into every working process and any roles. So tester is entirely fit in this process. But in the overall process tester maybe only involved in Check step.
