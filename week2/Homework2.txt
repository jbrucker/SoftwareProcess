In this course you will keep track of the time you spend on
project-related work, along with comments, for your own review.
For project-related work you should record:
<ul>
<li>date
<li>time spent
<li>task or activity
<li>work product (what you worked on)
<li>comments
</ul>

<p>
You can record this information using a software tool (app),
a document (file), or on paper, whatever you prefer.
If you use software, it should be able to create a report
containing the info listed above, which you will submit 
(either on paper or electronically) every few weeks.
In the TSP book, this information is written on form "LOGT" (p. 409),
although the LOGT form contains more detail than required.
