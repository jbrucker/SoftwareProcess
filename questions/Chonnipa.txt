1. What is different between RUP(Rational Unified Process) and AUP(Agile Unified Process)
(2)

Agile Unified Process (AUP) is a simplified version of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) developed by Scott Ambler.

The Rational Unified Process or RUP is a detailed refinement of the Unified Process.

2. What are benefits of using iterative process
(5)

Compared to the traditional waterfall process, the iterative process has the following advantages:
• Risks are mitigated earlier
• Change is more manageable
• Higher level of reuse
• The project team can learn along the way
• Better overall quality

3. What are examples of problems that Configuration Management should control?
(4)

- Simultaneous Update  When two or more workers work separately on the same artifact,
the last one to make changes destroys the work of the former.
- Limited Notification  When a problem is fixed in artifacts shared by several developers,
and some of them are not notified of the change.
- Multiple Versions  Most large programs are developed in evolutionary releases.
One release could be in customer use, while another is in test, and the third is still in development.
If problems are found in any one of the versions, fixes need to be propagated between them.
Confusion can arise leading to costly fixes and re-work unless changes are carefully controlled and monitored.

4. How version control helps configuration management?
(2 - previous answer was mostly related to VCS functions)

Version control helps preserve older versions of the programs whenever they are changed
