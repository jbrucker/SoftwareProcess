<h2>Team Assignment for Oct 13</h2>

<h3>Bookie</h3>

<p>
This assignment is in addition to work you have planned for this week.
Please continue work according to your project plan, but also do
the following and present work products in lab next week:
<ol>
<li>
A high-level design and architecture, including UML class diagram and UML component diagram.
</li>
<li>
Research and document solutions for how to get book information from ISBN or title/author information.  Today I showed Calibre as example proving that such info is available.
Add essential attributes of a book to your domain model.
</li>
<li>
Create one or more demo apps to get book information from a service. 
Please demonstrate that you can get book details for both Thai and English language books.
</li>
<li>
Identify components in your architecture, and select components to implement this iteration (which may be what is already in your SDP).
</li>
<li>
Rails has lots of reusable components. Find reusable components for authentication,
user management, and payments.  For authentication, it should have features like
password recovery (for userid/password auth) and authentication via Google or Facebook (using OAuth).  Record results of your search, with reasons why you chose a component
or didn't choose it.
</li>
<li>
Create a proof-of-concept app for each reusable component.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Youniversity</h2>

<p>
Please create a high-level design, including domain class diagram and component diagram with dependencies.  Review how you'll implement major features using your design to verify its adequate and fairly complete.
</p>
<p>
Youniversity is already planning a component-based design and using reusable components,
at least for authentication. Can you identify any others?
</p>

<h2>FECS</h2>

<p>
This assignment is in addition to work you already planned for this iteration.
Please continue work according to your project and iteration plan, but also do
the following and present work products in lab next week:
<ol>
<li>
Perform high level design and create a class diagram and component diagram.
Try to identify components in the design.
<br/>
Verify that you have identified sufficent domain classes (see next item). 
The class diagram reviewed in lab (7 Oct)
was missing many classes, and classes missing some important attributes.
</li>
<li>
Walk-through some important use cases using your component and domain class diagram,
to see how the flow of operations will use the classes in the design.
This is a check for whether your design will "work" for the use cases.
</li>
<li>
Search for and select existing software components or services for:
<ul>
<li>authentication and user management
<li>payments, esp. credit card
<li>order fulfillment
</ul>
Document the components you looked at and reason why you selected or rejected them
for use in your application.
<li>
For each reusable component that you will use in your application,
create a small demo app to prove it works at you require.
</li>
<li>
Create a prototype in Spring MVC for products.  The prototype should be able to:
<ul>
<li>view products
<li>add/edit a product
<li>use persistence (database of products)
</ul>
A crude user interface (web view) is sufficient.  The purpose is to demonstrate how to
design and implement persistence with Spring.
</li>
</ol>
