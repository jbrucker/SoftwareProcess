<h2>Work Products Due Next Week</h2>

<p>
These documents should be avaible in your CM system.
Please give read/write access to me and Sarun (mapfaps@gmail.com, sarun.w@ku.th).
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    <b>Coding Standard</b> (Developers): 
    Create a coding standard for your source code.
    It should conform to a commonly used standard and include rules for the following:
    (a) code format;
    (b) names of variables, methods, classes, packages, and files. Please <em>don't use</em> Hungarian notation or prefixing (such as "m" for "members") unless that's the language standard; 
    (c) in-code documentation and comments;
    (d) directory structure, including where to put source code and test code;
    (e) package structure,
    (f) anything else that is relevant to source code!
<p>
    The coding standard should include an example of all the rules.
    You should date it, so that if there are revisions later then people will know whether they have the current version.
</p>
</li>
<li>
    <b>Test Plan</b> (Testers):
    Create a form and instructions for planning and performing tests.
    There are lots of test forms on the Internet; study a few and choose what is suitable for your project.
    A test plan helps you design tests and ensures you don't
    forget anything during retesting. The form is used to report actual versus expected results, and identifies the work being tested (including version).  A test plan can be used for both manual and automatic testing, e.g. xUnit.
</li>
<li>
	<b>Baseline Identification &amp; Management<b> (CM):
	Clearly document in your CM PLan how will you identify and manage <b>baselines</b>. 
	Educate your team on the standard for baselines.
	This includes:
	<ul>
	<li>What products are baselined?</li>
	<li>When will you create a baseline?</li>
	<li>How is a baseline identified?</li>
	<li>After a baseline is created, the "baselined" items should not be modified.</li>
	<li>You should specify baselines for important docs like SRS and SDP. The Schedule in SDP should be preserved so original schedule can be compared to actual schedule, for learning.</li>
	<li>You should baseline source code at important milestones, deliverables such as end of iteration product, and other releases.  Unlike documents, you can use the VCS capabilities to identify baselines.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Plan Value and Earn Value Monitoring</b> (PMC):
	How do you know if you are on-track for this iteration?
	Assign <b>earned value</b> to all product-related tasks in the SDP and iteration plan.
