<h2>Work Products Due Next Week</h2>

<p>
These documents should be avaible in your CM system.
Please give read/write access to me and Sarun (mapfaps@gmail.com, sarun.w@ku.th).
</p>
<ol>
<li>
	<b>Software Development Plan</b> with <b>Schedule, Effort, and PV</b> estimates.
    All sections of the SDP should be written.
    <p></p> <!--whitespace -->
</li>
<li>
	<b>Schedule in SDP</b> should have a table of iterations showing what features or UC will be done
    in each iteration, and what work products will be produced.  
    The Schedule should show when you will implement <b>all</b> the UC and other requirements.
    You should schedule approx. the final 10% of time for system testing and fixing problems.
	<p>
    The PMC and PPQA should verify the schedule against the SRS. Are all requirements included?
        Are the time estimates consistent and reasonable?
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <b>Coding Standard</b> (Developers): 
    Create a coding standard for your source code.
    It should conform to a commonly used standard and include rules for the following:
    <ol type="a">
    
    <li> code format;
    <li> names of variables, methods, classes, packages, and files. Please <em>don't use</em> Hungarian notation or prefixing (such as "m" for "members") unless that's really the language standard; 
    <li> in-code documentation and comments;
    <li> directory structure, including where to put source code and test code;
    <li> package structure,
    <li> anything else that is relevant to source code!
    </ol>
    The coding standard should include an example of all the rules.
    You should date it, so that if there are revisions later then people will know whether they have the current version.
    <p>
    <b>Tooling Support:</b> Look for programming aids to make it easier to use your coding standard,
        and to verify code adheres to standard.  In Eclipse, language-specific formatting is in <tt>Preferences</tt> -&gt; <tt>Java</tt> -&gt; <tt>Code Style</tt> -&gt; <tt>Formatting</tt> (for Java); you can create and import your own formatting rules.  To check your code in Eclipse, enable Checkstyle for a project and supply your own Checkstyle rules for your coding standard (there are many checkstyle rule sets on the Internet).
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <b>Test Plan</b> (Testers):
    Create a form and instructions for planning and performing tests.
    There are lots of test forms on the Internet; study a few and choose what is suitable for your project.
    A test plan helps you design tests and ensures you don't
    forget anything during retesting. The form is used to report actual versus expected results, and identifies the work being tested (including version).  A test plan can be used for both manual and automatic testing, e.g. xUnit.
    <p></p> <!--whitespace -->
</li>
<li>
	<b>Baseline Identification &amp; Management</b> (CM):
	Clearly document in your CM PLan how will you identify and manage <b>baselines</b>. 
	Educate your team on what is a <b>baseline</b> and the standard for baselines.
    <p>
    A <b>baseline</b> provides a fixed reference. You use a baseline schedule to compare actual
        progress and effort against your plan. A baseline SRS provides requirements you can design from,
        and if requirements change, a baseline is needed to assess the change.
        A software baseline identifies work that has achieved some milestone or has been tested for
        some behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
    Your CM plan for baselines should specify:
	<ul>
	<li>What products are baselined?</li>
	<li>When will you create a baseline?</li>
	<li>How is a baseline identified?</li>
	<li>After a baseline is created, the "baselined" items should not be modified.</li>
        <li>You should specify baselines for important docs like SRS and SDP. The <b>Schedule</b> in SDP should be preserved so original schedule can be compared to actual schedule, for learning.</li>
	<li>Baseline source code at important milestones, deliverables such as end of iteration product, and releases.  Unlike documents, you can use the VCS capabilities to identify baselines.</li>
	</ul>
    <p></p> <!--whitespace -->
</li>
<li><b>Update to Weekly WAR</b> (PMC):
	<ul>
    <li>Modify names of weekly folders in include ending date, e.g. "Week Sep-26" instead of Week2.
        This is because each team is using different numberings making it hard for management to identify weeks.
        </li>
        <li>The plan should show how each person used his working time. List each activity and task done be each person on team. Don't combine them.</li>
        <li>Include milestones done and milestones missed (planned for this week but not achieved).</li>
        <li>(Optional) EV of tasks done this week. EV is the PV (plan value) from the SDP.</li>
        <li>You should <b>check</b> that the report is accurate.</li>
	</ul>
    <p></p> <!--whitespace -->
</li>
<li><b>Verify Activity</b> (PPQA)
    Verify that info in the individual and team activity reports is accurate and complete.
    Last week (Sep 15) there were many errors and omissions in the weekly report!
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Oral Reports</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Present your schedule and rationale for it.</li>
    <li>Present the coding standard and example of using it. </li>
    <li>Weekly report.</li>
</ol>
<p>

</p>

<h2>Review in Lab</h2>

<p><em>To be complated.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Your Schedule, iteration plan, and SRS.</li>
<li>High level design of your solution.</li>
<li>Evidence of background work related to your project domain.
Domain knowledge and interview with potential users are both essential to creating a good product.

</ol>

<h2>Useful Books</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>
        Jalote, <em>Software Project Managment in Practice</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        This short book describes project management at Infosys.
        I think it is a useful guide for some of your roles.
        It has a chapters on Project Planning, Configuration Management,
        PMC, Quality Planning, the Project Management Plan, and Reviews.
        You can read the first few chapters at Google Books.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Stellman &amp; Greene, <em>Applied Software Project Managment</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Easy to understand descriptions of many of the practices
        you are using, including script-like guidance for some activities.
