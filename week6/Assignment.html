<h2>Work for Sep 29</h2>
<ol>
<li>
	This week please inspect your SRS, then rework the document, and follow-up on the rework.
</li>
<li>
	The coding standards presented last week were incomplete and lacked a complete example
	of code that uses your standard.  Please revise the coding standards and create a complete
	code example.
	The coding standards are a process asset.  Its also helpful to have them in your project
	wiki (even though this means duplication) for convenient access by developers.
</li>
<li>
	All developers and testers should be assigned project-related work.
	Testers should create specific test plans, test cases, and write actual tests for the
	features already implemented and features currently being implemented.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Work Products Due Sep 29</h2>

<p>
These documents should be available in your CM system.
Please give read/write access to me and Sarun (mapfaps@gmail.com, sarun.w@ku.th).
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Inspection report for SRS inspection, and a revised SRS with the inspection defects fixed,
		suggestions incorporated, and the revisions approved by inspectors. 
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Coding Standards with Complete Example</b> - last week all the coding standards were
	incomplete and not clear how to use them.  They also were not in correct location.
	For this week:
	<ul>
		<li>revise and improve the coding standards. Include details of how to use comments to
			(a) provide code documentation, (b) document logic or reasoning in code.
		</li>
		<li>provide an example that uses everything in your coding standard.
		</li>
		<li>be prepared to demonstrate how to use the coding standard and how to
			create code documentation (aka Javadoc).
			I may ask <b>any developer</b> on your team to demo use of the standard,
			so every developer better be familiar with it!
		</li>
		<li>
			Ideally, this code documentation
			should be immediately recognizable to the IDE, so the IDE can use it
			to provide inline help to developers.
		</li>
		<li>
			Put the documents in the correct place!
			On Google Drive, its a process asset.
			It would also be useful to have the coding standard w/ example in your code
			repository (e.g. the wiki) so its immediately available to developers.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>
	<b>No More "Learning" tasks in Activity Reports</b>
	- starting this week, please do <b>not</b> report
	time spent learning programming languages, frameworks, or tools in your weekly
	activity report.  Do that on your own time.  The SKE Company (employer) only allows
	so much time for training; after that they expect productive work.
	All developers and testers should now be doing project-related work.
</li>

<li>
    <b>Formatting of Plans and Docs</b> -
		plans and other documents for management should have a footer that
		includes (a) brief project and document title,
		(b) version and date edited, (c) page number.
		<br/>
		For example, "FECS SRS rev. 1.0    25/9/2015   Page 5".
		<br/>
		The page size should be A4 and margins no larger than 0.5-inch (1.27cm).
	</p>
	<p>
		The version numbering should follow the versioning rules in your CM plan.
		It is <b>not</b> necessary to change the version every time you edit a file!
		Reserve version updates for meaningful changes;
		In SRS and SDP, such changes are reviewed and approved.
		<p>
		Suppose you were involved in 3 projects, and the SRS are each 40+ pages long
		(many SRS are over 100 pages).
		You might print them out to make it easy to flip back-and-forth through
		the requirements, esp. during design.
		<br/>
		So, you've got three 40+ page print-outs on your desk.
		How are you going to know which pages belong to which project?  Or whether
		the SRS is up-to-date?  A good page footer makes it easy to identify them.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <b>Test Plans, Testing, and Test Reports</b> (Testers):
    Create test plans and test cases for features your team is working on or has already implemented.
	Write test code (and do manual testing where it makes sense) and actually test the work,
	then record your results.  Defects should feed back into the issue tracker,
	but you also was a record of defects for QA and process improvement.
    <p></p> <!--whitespace -->
</li>

<li><b>Verify Activity</b> (PPQA)
    Verify that info in the individual and team activity reports is accurate and complete.
    Verify that team members are reporting project work and not learning/training time.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Oral Reports</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
		Update on work done this week and goals for this iteration.
		<br/>Each team member should have a work product that reflects what they worked on.
	</li>
	<li>
		Update team <b>role assignments</b>.
		Each team can devote at most 1 person-equivalent
		to the CM, PMC, and PPQA roles.  That means 1 person to each role,
		or 2 people working 1/2-time at the role.
		I think that 3 people working 1/3-time on a role is inefficient due
		to need for communication and inefficiency in dividing the work.
	</li>
	<li>
		Demo your coding standard and how to produce API documentation from it.
		I will choose the demonstrators, so everyone should memorize the coding standard.
		Even better: configure your IDE to do it for you.
	</li>
</ol>
