## 2. There are many approaches to do the estimation, how do you know whether to use Bottom-up, Top-down, or use-cases approach?
  > Bottom-up estimation is effective when
  project details are known.  
  > Use Top-down approach if you can estimate the size and productivity.  
  > Use the use case approach when using a use-case-based development.

## 3. What is the main purpose of doing the Review?
  > The purpose of a review is to identify defects and issues in a work product through a process of formal
  and structured review by a group of peers.

    Jalote, Software Project Management in Practice, section 10.5.

## 4. In project estimation, if two people widely disagree on how long a task will take, what should you do?
  > Let them share and discuss their assumptions together, then do the estimation again, Repeatedly do this until the disagreements are resolved or an acceptable resolution is found.
