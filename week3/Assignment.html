<h2>Work Products Due Next Week</h2>

<p>
These documents should be avaible in your CM system.
Please give read/write access to me and Sarun (mapfaps@gmail.com, sarun.w@ku.th).
</p><ol>
<li>
<b>Vision</b>: more detailed vision of your product.
Do some background study to learn about the domain, don't just invent
something from a vacuum.  Cite useful references.
<br>
E-commerce Team: specify a particular target audience, such as type
of business or type of product. This will make the needs/requirements more specific.
</li><li>
<b>SRS</b>: requirements for the application, consistent with your vision.
I will be "product owner" for all projects, and may modify the requirements. E-commerce project should use my SRS as starting point.</li><li>
<b>Software Development Plan</b>: first draft of plan. Use the RUP SDP template,
but tailor it.  Omit sections that don't apply; leave blank those you don't have any plan yet. 
You should include:
  <ul>
  <li>Project scope
  </li><li>Project organization, including people, roles, and responsibilities
  </li><li>Development plan - overall method of development
  </li><li>Project estimates, esp. effort.
  </li><li>Iteration objectives, schedule, and milestones
  </li><li>Configuration Management plan, by reference
  </li><li>Quality Assurance Plan, by reference
  </li><li>Project Tracking - when is your weekly meeting? when are individual 
      activity reports due? when will weekly project progress report be available?
     You will report to management (me) weekly, on Tuesday afternoon.
  </li></ul>
</li><li>
<b>Configuration Management Plan</b>: detail what artifacts you will manage,
  where they will be located, naming convention, and access (who can read or write). 
  For documents, specify a directory structure.
<br>
In the CM plan don't expect to think of <em>everything</em> now, 
but include all items you know about.
</li><li>
<b>Quality Assurance Plan</b>: 
how your team will assess and improve quality.
This includes reviews, defect tracking, and testing.
May include other activities and measures, too.
</li><li>
<b>Weekly Activity Report</b>:
design a form for team members' weekly activity report, and how this data
will be collected. This is a PMC responsibility.
</li></ol>

<h2>Oral Reports</h2>

<p>
Each team will report in class.
Reports should be concise and not more than 10 minutes.
Be prepared for questions.

</p><ol>
<li>Weekly Report: what you did this week, open issues, what you plan to do next week
</li><li>Brief summary of project plan
</li><li>Summary of CM plan by CM person
</li></ol>

<h2>Review in Lab</h2>

<p>
In this week's lab I would like to review each team's Vision, SRS,
conceptual design, and SDP.
You can also use this time for project work.

</p><p>
It is important that the requirements are stabilized soon
so that your plans are stable, too.

</p><h2>Special Consideration for PPQA and PMC Roles</h2>

<p>
The PPQA and PMC roles are important to monitoring your project health.
The persons in these roles should be reliable and diligent.
If a developer does a poor job, others will detect problems in his work.
If PPQA or PMC does a poor job, the project may be off-track but you may not notice it.
</p>
<p>
The PPQA and PMC roles will provide status reports to me,
so they should be able to converse and write in English.
</p>

<h2>Useful Book</h2>

<blockquote>
Jalote, <em>Software Project Managment in Practice</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
This short book describes project management at Infosys.
I think it is a useful guide for some of your roles.
It has a chapters on Project Planning, Configuration Management,
PMC, Quality Planning, the Project Management Plan, and Reviews.
You can read the first few chapters at Google Books.
</p><p>
I will bring a copy of this book next week,
but maybe you can find it sooner.
