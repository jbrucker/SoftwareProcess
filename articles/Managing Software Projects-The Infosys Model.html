                Software project management is perhaps the most important factor in the outcome of a project. Without proper project management, a project will almost certainly fail.  In this introduction from his book, <i>Software Project Management in Practice</i>, Pankaj  Jalote explains the basis for effective project management, based on the model at Infosys.
                </div>

            
<p>Worldwide, some half a million project managers execute about a million
software projects each year, producing software worth $600 billion. Many of
these projects fail to fulfill customers' quality expectations or fail to
deliver the software within budget and on schedule. One analysis suggests that
about one-third of projects have cost and schedule overruns of more than
125%.<a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn01.html')"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>	Why do so many software projects fail? Although there are many reasons, one
of the most important is improper management of the project. For example, the
major reasons for runaways (projects that are out of control) are unclear
objectives, bad planning, new technology, a lack of a project management
methodology, and insufficient staff.<a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn02.html')"><sup>2</sup></a> At least three of these five
reasons clearly relate to project management. The other two—insufficient
staff and new technology—can be considered as risks whose management is
also a part of project management.</p>
<p>	Clearly, by using effective project management techniques a project manager
can improve the chances of success. But what are these effective techniques?</p>
<p>	Let's consider an analogy. Suppose you want to develop a muscular,
toned body. To reach your goal, you start looking at exercise routines described
in magazines. One article describes how to develop arm strength, giving a set of
10 exercises to be done—not too many by any standard. But then another
article, this one on developing thigh strength, also gives 10 exercises, and the
evangelist for flat stomachs also feels that doing 10 exercises is not too much.
If you want to develop your body overall by following each of these isolated
exercise programs, you would find that you have a set of 50 to 100 exercises to
do—a clear impossibility for most people, let alone a busy project manager.
To achieve your objective, you need a comprehensive training program that is
practical and effective.</p>
<p>	Similarly, you'll find an abundance of suggestions for performing the
various aspects of project management, including effort estimation, risk
management, project monitoring, configuration management, and so on. Although
each proposed technique solves the problem it is designed to solve, it is not
clear how to combine these techniques into a practical and workable process. For
effective project management, the need of the hour is a practical, manageable
"exercise routine" that will deliver the result. In other words, what
is needed is a balanced process that covers the management of the entire project
from inception to completion. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of published
approaches illustrating how to integrate techniques in this way.</p>
<p>	This book fills this gap by describing the set of processes used in a
world-class organization to effectively and efficiently manage software
projects. The company is Infosys, a software development company that has an
enviable track record of project execution; in 2000 alone, Infosys project
managers used the processes described here to successfully execute about 500
projects for customers. This book discusses all aspects of Infosys project
management—planning, execution, and closure. You'll learn how Infosys
project managers estimate, plan for managing risks, collect metrics data, set
quality goals, use measurements for monitoring a project, and so on. An
interesting aspect of these processes, one that will appeal to busy project
managers, is that they are neither complex nor cumbersome, and they use simple
metrics.</p>
<p>	Infosys has been assessed at level 5 (the highest level) of the Capability
Maturity Model (CMM). By extracting project management processes from the set of
processes at Infosys, this book also illustrates how projects are managed in a
high-maturity organization. Through this illustration, I hope to bring the
benefits of the CMM to project managers who have not studied it because of lack
of time, because they regard it as being for "process folks" or
because they have found it difficult to relate the CMM to project management
practices.</p>
<p>	This chapter introduces the two topics that form the background for the
book: the CMM and Infosys. Because the focus of the book is project management
and not the CMM, I restrict the discussion to the project management aspects of
the CMM. This chapter also provides an overview of the project management
process and the main case study; details of these are discussed in the remainder
of the book. First, then, let's briefly discuss the role of processes in
project management.</p>
<h2>1.1 Processes and Project Management</h2>
<p>A software project has two main activity dimensions: engineering and project
management. The engineering dimension deals with building the system and focuses
on issues such as how to design, test, code, and so on. The project management
dimension deals with properly planning and controlling the engineering
activities to meet project goals for cost, schedule, and quality.</p>
<p>	If a project is small (say, a team of one or two working for a few weeks),
it can be executed somewhat informally. The project plan may be an e-mail
specifying the delivery date and perhaps a few intermediate milestones.
Requirements might be communicated in a note or even verbally, and intermediate
work products, such as design documents, might be scribbles on personal note
pads.</p>
<p>These informal techniques, however, do not scale up for larger projects in
which many people may work for many months—the situation for most
commercial software projects. In such projects, each engineering task must be
done carefully by following well-tried methodologies, and the work products must
be properly documented so that others can review them. The tasks in the project
must be carefully planned and allocated to project personnel and then tracked as
the project executes. In other words, to successfully execute larger projects,
formality and rigor along these two dimensions must increase.</p>
<p>Formality requires that well-defined processes be used for performing the
various tasks so that the outcome becomes more dependent on the capability of
the processes. Formality is further enhanced if quantitative approaches are
employed in the processes through the use of suitable metrics.</p>
<p>What is a process? Technically, a <i>process</i> for a task comprises a
sequence of steps that should be followed to execute the task. For an
organization, however, the processes it recommends for use by its engineers and
project managers are much more than a sequence of steps; they encapsulate what
the engineers and project managers have learned about successfully executing
projects. Through the processes, the benefits of experience are conferred to
everyone, including newcomers in the organization. These processes help managers
and engineers emulate past successes and avoid the pitfalls that lead to
failures. </p>
<p>For a project, the engineering processes generally specify how to perform
engineering activities such as requirement specification, design, testing, and
so on. The project management processes, on the other hand, specify how to set
milestones, organize personnel, manage risks, monitor progress, and so on. This
book focuses on the project management process. </p>
<p>When you consider project management processes, you must ask the question
whether project managers will use them. I have often heard process designers
complain that project managers don't follow the process and that they
resist changes. My experience with project managers at Infosys and other
organizations is that they actually want to use processes but only if
they're reasonable and will help the project managers execute their
projects better. Project managers do, however, resent processes that seem to be
unnecessarily bureaucratic and add little value to their work. The trick, then,
is to have <i>lightweight</i> processes—those that help project managers
plan and control their projects better and that give them the flexibility to
handle various situations.</p>
<p>In response to the question "Why should project managers follow
processes?" S.D. Shibulal—founder, director, and the current head of
customer delivery at Infosys—sums it up nicely in a few key points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Processes represent collective knowledge. Using them increases your
chances of success.</p></li>
<li><p>A process may have some extra steps, but you will not always know
beforehand which ones are not needed, and hence you will increase your risks by
taking shortcuts.</p></li>
<li><p>Without processes, you cannot predict much about the outcome of your
project.</p></li>
<li><p>You and the organization cannot learn effectively without having defined
processes. And learning and improvement are imperative in today's
knowledge-based world.</p></li>
<li><p>Processes lower your anxiety level. The checklists inevitably cover 80
percent of what needs to be done. Hence, your task reduces to working out the
remaining 20 percent.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>1.2 Project Management and the CMM</h2>
<p>Once it is accepted that use of effective processes can help in executing a
project successfully, a question immediately arises: What are the desirable
characteristics of these processes? The CMM for software is a framework that
tries to answer this question. </p>
<p>The CMM for software is a framework that was developed by the Software
Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University by observing the best
practices in software and other organizations. Hence, the CMM reflects the
collective process experience and expectations of many companies. It specifies
desired characteristics of processes without prescribing specific processes.
Thus, different processes can fulfill the requirements of the CMM. It can be
used to evaluate the software process of an organization and to identify
deficiencies.</p>
<p>The CMM is one of the most popular frameworks for software process
improvement (the other commonly used framework is ISO 9001<a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn03.html')"><sup>3</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn04.html')"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn05.html')"><sup>5</sup></a>). The
foundations of the CMM were laid down in Watts Humphrey's <i>Managing the
Software Process</i>,<a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn06.html')"><sup>6</sup></a> and the framework itself is described
completely in the SEI's <i>The Capability Maturity Model: Guidelines for
Improving the Software Process</i>.<a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn07.html')"><sup>7</sup></a> A "new edition" of the CMM, called CMM-I, has been released. But because the focus of this book is not
on the models and because there is still little experience available with CMM-I,
I discuss only the CMM for software and only the project management aspects,
even though the CMM also covers organizational and process management issues. I
do not discuss the assessment procedure, a brief description of which is given
in my book <i>CMM in Practice</i>,<a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn01.html')"><sup>8</sup></a> and a detailed description given in <i>CMM Based Appraisal for Internal Process Improvement,</i> by S.
Masters.<a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn01.html')"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3>1.2.1 Overview of the CMM</h3>
<p>One objective of the CMM is to distinguish mature processes from immature, or
ad hoc, processes. Immature software processes imply that projects are executed
without many guidelines, and the outcome of a project depends largely on the
capability of the team and the project leader. On the other hand, with mature
processes, a project is executed by following defined processes. In this case,
the outcome of the project is less dependent on people and more on the
processes. It follows, then, that the more mature the processes, the more
predictable the results and the more well controlled the projects.</p>
<p>The range of results that can be expected in a project when it is executed
using a process is its <i>process capability. </i>The actual result achieved in
a project executed using the process is its<i> process performance. </i>Clearly,
the process performance depends on the process capability. To consistently
improve process performance on projects, you must enhance the process
capability; the process itself must become more mature.</p>
<p>The path to higher maturity includes some well-defined plateaus referred to
as <i>maturity levels </i>by the CMM. Each maturity level specifies certain
characteristics for processes, with higher maturity levels having more advanced
characteristics that are found in more mature software processes. Hence, the CMM
framework describes the key elements of software processes at different levels
of maturity. Consequently, it also specifies the path that a software process
follows in moving from immature processes to highly mature processes. This path
includes five maturity levels, as shown in <a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/01fig01.gif')">Figure 1.1</a>.<a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn07.html')"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><b><a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/01fig01.gif')">Figure 1.1</a>  Maturity levels in the CMM</b></p>
<p>In level 1, the <i>initial</i> level, a project is executed in a manner that
the team and project manager see fit. The <i>repeatable</i> level (level 2)
applies when established project management practices are employed, although
organization-wide processes may not exist. At the <i>defined</i> level (level
3), organization-wide processes have been defined and are regularly followed. At
the <i>managed</i> level (level 4), quantitative understanding of the process
capability makes it possible to quantitatively predict and control the process
performance on a project. At the <i>optimizing</i> level (level 5), the process
capability is improved in a controlled manner and the improvement is evaluated
quantitatively.</p>
<p>Each maturity level (except level 1) is characterized by <i>key process
areas</i> (KPAs), which specify the areas on which the organization should focus
to elevate its processes to that maturity level. <a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/01fig01.gif')">Figure 1.1</a> also shows the KPAs
for the different levels. For an organization to achieve a maturity level, it
must satisfy all the KPAs at that maturity level as well as the KPAs at all
lower maturity levels.</p>
<p>Maintaining processes at higher levels of maturity is a challenging task
requiring commitment from the organization and a proper work culture. Of the 900
assessments conducted between 1996 and June 2000 whose assessment results were
provided to the SEI, only 3% of the organizations were at level 5, and another
5% were at level 4.<a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn10.html')"><sup>10</sup></a> The rest were at level 3 or below, with 38% at level 2 and 18% at level 3.</p>
<h3>1.2.2 KPAs for Project Management</h3>
<p>Each KPA specifies goals that the processes of the organization must meet to
satisfy that KPA. In addition, each KPA specifies a group of activities, called
<i>key practices</i>, that collectively satisfy the goals of that KPA. In many
senses, the goals for each KPA capture its essence. They specify the objectives
that the CMM has set for the processes relating to the KPA. To illustrate the
KPAs associated with project management, we briefly discuss here the goals of
these KPAs. These goals are taken from the CMM,<a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn07.html')"><sup>7</sup></a> with some minor
changes in the wording of some goals. </p>
<p>Table 1.1 lists all the goals for KPAs at level 2, showing clearly that the
level 2 focus is almost exclusively on project management. Under these goals,
you create and document a project plan, evaluate the ongoing project performance
against the plan, and take actions when the actual performance significantly
deviates from the plan. Requirements are properly documented, and changes to
requirements are properly managed. All work products are controlled, and changes
to products are properly managed through a planned configuration management
plan. Reviews and audits are performed to ensure that planned processes and
standards are being followed. If some parts of the project are subcontracted to
other vendors, the subcontracted work is also monitored properly.</p>

<p>Table 1.2 details the goals of three of the seven KPAs at level
3. The other KPAs focus on organizational and process management issues. A
project in a level 3 organization uses a tailored version of the standard
process and reuses assets, data, and experience from past projects for planning.
The various groups that contribute to the project cooperate smoothly through
well-defined interfaces and mechanisms. Reviews are properly carried out to
identify defects in work products, and sufficient support for conducting reviews
and follow-up activities is provided.</p>

<p>Table 1.3 shows the goals for the two KPAs at level 4. At level 4, the
capability of the organization's process is understood in quantitative
terms. The process capability is used to set quantitative goals for a project.
Data on project performance are collected on an ongoing basis and are compared
with data on past performance; if significant deviations are observed, proper
corrective actions are applied to bring the project back in control. A key
aspect of level 4 is the use of statistical process control techniques on an
ongoing basis so that each activity can be evaluated and corrective action taken
if needed.</p>

to identify defects in work products, and sufficient support for conducting

<p>The three KPAs at level 5 focus on improving the capability of the process.
Of the three KPAs, the Defect Prevention KPA is the one that most directly
affects project management. This KPA requires that defects be prevented
proactively by systematically analyzing the causes of defects and then
eliminating those causes. If defects can be prevented from entering the
software, the effort spent in removing them can be reduced, thereby improving
quality and productivity.</p>

<h2>1.3 Project Management at Infosys</h2>
<p>Infosys executes hundreds of projects each year. Full responsibility for
executing a project rests with the project manager, who must make sure that the
project team delivers high-quality software to the customer on time and within
cost. To help the project manager fulfill this responsibility, support from the
organization is necessary. This section provides a brief background on Infosys
and its support for managing projects.</p>
<h3>1.3.1 Background: Infosys</h3>
<p>Infosys is a software house headquartered in Bangalore, India. Its stated
mission is "to be a globally respected corporation that provides
best-of-breed software solutions delivered by best-in-class people." It
employs the global delivery model, in which the customer can be located anywhere
in the world and customer fulfillment can be provided from anywhere. In this
model, the customer is sought anywhere in the world where it provides the most
value to the company. For customer fulfillment, a combination of processes,
technology, and management is employed to segregate the work so that value can
be added in the most optimum locations and then reaggregated for delivery to the
customer.</p>
<p>Infosys currently employs about 10,000 people, with about 15 development
centers in four countries and offices in more than a dozen countries. The
company was founded in 1981 by seven software professionals with an equity base
of only $300. Today, Infosys has a market capitalization of more than $8 billion
(based on market rates in June 2001), and its revenue was more than $400 million
in 2000 (revenue in 1994 was $9.5 million). Its customers are spread across the
globe and include major corporations—more than 60 of them being Fortune
1000 companies—that are engaged in diverse businesses such as banking,
retailing, manufacturing, telecommunications, financial services, insurance, and
transportation.</p>
<p>Infosys is a highly respected company that has been rated as the best
managed and most respected company in India and one of Asia's leading
information technology (IT) companies. It has bagged many awards, including the
Ramakrishna Bajaj award, which is modeled after the Malcolm Balridge award. It
can be safely said that Infosys is one of the best software services
corporations in the world.</p>
<p>Infosys provides a top-notch infrastructure so that its project managers can
better serve the needs of its worldwide customers. The company has provided
audio conferencing facilities to almost every group so that project managers can
interact easily with customers and with group members located in different
sites. Similarly, a state-of-the-art video conferencing facility is used for
interaction among the company's various locations as well as for virtual
meetings. Its main campus in Bangalore is now one of the largest software
service facilities in the world, with work-related facilities such as a library,
extensive computing and networking facilities, training facilities, discussion
rooms, projection facilities, and so on, as well as recreational facilities such
as an art gallery, a health club, and facilities for tennis, basketball, and so
on.</p>
<p>Process orientation and improvement are a part of the Infosys work culture,
and processes are defined for most tasks that are performed regularly. For
process definition and improvement, Infosys first adopted the ISO 9000 framework
and got its ISO certification in 1993. To further improve the software process,
Infosys then adopted the CMM framework. It was first assessed at level 4 in
December 1997, and then at level 5 in December 1999. In its pursuit of
continuous improvement, Infosys now employs the Malcolm Balridge framework for
all-around improvement and building leadership excellence in all areas of
operation.</p>
<h3>1.3.2 SEPG Support to Projects</h3>
<p>The quality department at Infosys contains the software engineering process
group (SEPG). The SEPG is responsible for coordinating all the process
activities, including process definition, process improvement, and process
deployment. It also manages all information and data related to the use of
processes (such as the process database and the process capability baseline,
which are discussed further in Chapter 2).</p>
<p>Although the responsibility for all aspects of delivery, including quality,
belongs to the project team, the SEPG facilitates the project team in following
the right processes. The SEPG also forms an independent channel for monitoring
and reporting to senior management on process and quality issues. Because
"processes won't stick by themselves,"<a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn06.html')"><sup>6</sup></a> the SEPG helps
to ensure that the defined processes are implemented and become standard
practice.</p>
<p>To this end, in addition to offering training on processes, the SEPG
provides a member who is associated with a project as a <i>software quality
adviser</i>. The quality adviser assists in defining and following processes,
ensures that the processes are followed, aids in analyzing the data, and
provides any needed process training. Because the adviser is well versed on
processes, guidelines, and so on, the adviser's main help comes during
project planning. The adviser also reviews the project plan to ensure that it
contains all the key elements.</p>
<p>In addition to providing consulting and help with processes and metrics, the
Infosys SEPG schedules and manages regular independent audits (see Chapter 11)
to ensure that the defined processes and standards are being followed.</p>
<h3>1.3.3 Senior Management Involvement in Projects</h3>
<p>Infosys prides itself in providing value to its customers through delivery
excellence. Everything at Infosys, including its organizational structure, is
driven by the aim of serving customers efficiently and effectively and quickly
tapping new business opportunities.</p>
<p>For delivery of customer services, Infosys has many <i>business units</i>.
Within a business unit, a <i>team,</i> headed by a <i>project manager</i>,
executes a project. The project manager is responsible for all aspects of
project execution, from determining the requirements to final installation of
the software. The project manager reports to a <i>business manager</i>, who in
turn generally reports to the <i>business unit head</i>.</p>
<p>To handle situations that cannot be resolved by the project manager, senior
management involvement in projects is essential. At Infosys, the business
manager regularly interacts with the project manager and monitors the project
through status reports and milestone reports (discussed in Chapter 11). In
addition to regular monitoring, the business manager also helps to resolve
issues and problems that cannot be handled by the project team and are
<i>escalated</i> to his level (escalation is discussed in Chapter 8). The
business manager also interacts with customers to ensure that they are satisfied
and that any issues are promptly raised and addressed.</p>
<p>In addition, other senior people also review projects periodically by
regularly taking part in internal audits (discussed in Chapter 11). Through two
systems—called PRISM (project review by senior management) and IPM
(integrated project management)—milestone reports and project plans are
available for senior management to review. All senior managers are expected to
review some projects periodically through this system and to give feedback to
the project leaders.</p>
<p>Overall, senior management maintains involvement in the project primarily by
monitoring to ensure that the project objectives are met and that the customer
is fully satisfied.</p>
<h3>1.3.4 Training for Project Managers</h3>
<p>Because project managers have the main responsibility for satisfying the
customer, they need to master not only executing the technical aspects of a
project but also interacting with customers, eliciting requirements, managing
the team, and so on. Clearly no one is likely to possess all the skills needed,
so it's crucial to train people to develop the necessary skills. Infosys
has implemented a variety of programs to help people transition from being
engineers to being project leaders.</p>
<p>All fresh entrants undergo a three- to four-month <i>induction training
program.</i> In addition to training in engineering and technology, this program
contains one- or two-day programs in business etiquette, written communication,
public speaking, body language, and so on.</p>
<p>Later, when engineers are ready to become <i>module leaders</i> (those who
manage the development of a system module, especially in larger projects) or
project managers, they attend a series of technical and soft-skills training
programs. Included in the former is a five-day project management course that
focuses on all aspects of project management: planning, monitoring, controlling,
and so on. A two-week course on requirements specification and management
teaches how to elicit requirements, how to document them, how to verify them,
and so on. The five-day residential soft-skills training program includes
modules on appraisals and team management, customer focus and customer
management, leadership, social and business etiquette for different countries,
and so on.</p>
<p>Other regularly offered programs focus on various aspects of management;
project leaders take these courses when their schedules permit. Also,
team-building workshops are conducted by professionals.</p>
<h3>1.3.5 The Project Management Process</h3>
<p>For a project team to successfully execute a project, it must perform
hundreds of tasks, many of them interdependent. Effectively managing this
process is extremely important for success. At Infosys, the set of activities
executed by a project manager is specified in the <i>project management
</i>process. It is fairly standard, having three main stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project planning</li>
<li>Project execution</li>
<li>Project closure</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <i>project planning </i>stage, the project manager reviews
contractual commitments and creates a plan to meet them. Creating a project plan
involves defining a life-cycle process to be followed, estimating the effort and
schedule, preparing a detailed schedule of tasks, and so on. It also includes
planning for quality and configuration management as well as risk management. In
this phase, the major activities of the project manager are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Perform startup and administrative tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a project plan and schedule.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Define the project objectives.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify a suitable standard process for project execution.</p></li>
<li><p>Tailor the standard process to meet project requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Define a process for managing changes in requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Estimate the effort.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan for human resources and team organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Define the project milestones and create a schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>Define the quality objectives and a quality plan to achieve
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a defect prevention plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify risks and make plans to mitigate them.</p></li>
<li><p>Define a measurement plan for the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Define a training plan for the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Define project-tracking procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Perform a review of the project plan and schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain authorization from senior management.</p></li>
<li><p>Define and review the configuration management plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Orient the project team to the project management plan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the project manager, this phase involves the customer, an
SEPG representative, and the business manager for the project. The entry
criterion is that the contract or project authorization is available. The exit
criterion is that the project plan has been documented and group reviewed (see
Chapter 10).</p>
<p>The second phase, <i>project execution, </i>involves executing the project
plan, tracking the status of the project, and making corrections whenever
project performance strays from the path laid down in the project plan. In other
words, it involves tracking and controlling the implementation of the project
process. This phase is the longest in the project management process,
incorporating periodic tasks such as monitoring project status and quality and
taking any needed corrective steps. In this phase, the project manager performs
these main activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Execute the project as per the project plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Track the project status.</p></li>
<li><p>Review the project status with senior management.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor compliance with the defined project process.</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze defects and perform defect prevention activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor performance at the program level.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct milestone reviews and replan if necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other members of the team also participate in this stage. The entry
criterion is that the project plan is complete and approved, and the exit
criterion is that all work products delivered are accepted by the customer.</p>
<p>The last stage of the project management process, <i>project closure,
</i>involves a systematic wind-up of the project after customer acceptance. The
main goal here is to learn from the experience so that the process can be
improved. Post-project data analysis constitutes the main activity; metrics are
analyzed, process assets (materials, such as templates and guidelines, used to
aid in managing the process itself) are collected for future use, and lessons
are recorded. Because learning from the project is the main goal, this is a
group activity that involves the project manager, the SEPG, and other members of
the team. The entry criterion is that the customer has accepted the work
products. The exit criterion is that a postproject meeting has been conducted.
The main outputs of this phase are the project closure report and the collected
process assets.</p>
<p>The remainder of this book discusses the various elements of this management
process. Part I includes separate chapters devoted to key planning activities,
such as process definition and tailoring, risk management, effort and schedule
estimation, quality planning, and configuration management planning. The other
tasks in the planning phase (such as human resource planning, project
organization, tools to be used, project tracking procedures, and so on) are
discussed briefly in Chapters 7 and 8. Part II includes chapters on project
monitoring and controlling and on project closure.</p>

<h2>1.4 Overview of the ACIC Case Study</h2>
<p>ACIC Corporation (name changed to protect confidentiality) is a
multibillion-dollar financial institution. To keep up with the times, several
years ago it started slowly Web-enabling its applications, and it wanted to
start an on-line service for opening and tracking accounts. Because Infosys had
successfully built some e-services for ACIC earlier in a project called Synergy
(name changed), ACIC employed Infosys to analyze the problem. This work was
executed in <i>time and material</i> (T&amp;M) mode—that is, the customer
paid for the effort spent by Infosys in doing the analysis. Based on the
analysis output, Infosys made a successful bid for the Web project, giving rise
to the ACIC case study that runs throughout this book. The project successfully
released the new service in time, and the software has been in operation without
any problem. (This case study is different from the WAR project case study
discussed in my earlier book.<a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap1_0201737213/elementLinks/ch01fn06.html')"><sup>6</sup></a>)</p>
<p>	The ACIC project illustrates the various project planning and monitoring
tasks undertaken in executing a project at Infosys. Many of the outputs related
to management of the ACIC project are given in the relevant chapters. These
include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The data from the Synergy project, which was used by the ACIC project
manager during planning (Chapter 2)</p></li>
<li><p>The project's process plan (Chapter 3)</p></li>
<li><p>An analysis of the impact of a requirement change request (Chapter
3)</p></li>
<li><p>Effort estimates and the high-level schedule, along with a description of
how they were obtained (Chapter 4)</p></li>
<li><p>The quality plan containing quality goals and plans for achieving them,
including plans for defect prevention and reviews (Chapter 5) </p></li>
<li><p>The risk management plan describing the major risks, their risk exposure
and impact, their prioritization, and the risk mitigation plans for the
high-priority risks (Chapter 6)</p></li>
<li><p>The measurement and tracking plan (Chapter 7)</p></li>
<li><p>The complete project management plan, including the team management plan
and the customer communication and escalation plan (Chapter 8)</p></li>
<li><p>The complete configuration management plan (Chapter 9)</p></li>
<li><p>Project tracking documents, including the defect log, the issues log, the
status report, and the milestone report (Chapter 11)</p></li>
<li><p>Details of defect prevention, including defect analysis results and the
impact on the project of the defect prevention plan (Chapter 11)</p></li>
<li><p>The complete closure report, which includes the metrics data on quality,
productivity, cost of quality, defect removal efficiency, and so on
(Chapter 12) </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>1.5 Summary</h2>
<p>Software project management is perhaps the most important factor in the
outcome of a project. Without proper project management, a project will almost
certainly fail. Many organizations have evolved effective project management
processes. This book describes these processes for one such organization,
Infosys, which has been assessed at level 5 of the CMM and whose project
managers have successfully executed hundreds of projects. </p>
<p>	Here are the key takeaways from this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Processes for the various aspects of project management should not be
looked at in isolation. In a balanced process, the practices integrate
smoothly.</p></li>
<li><p>Processes of an organization should encapsulate its best practices so as
to help new projects replicate past successes and avoid failures.</p></li>
<li><p>At the top level, the project management process consists of three
phases: planning, execution, and closure.</p></li>
<li><p>For effective execution of projects, project managers should be supported
through the help of an SEPG in executing processes; senior management monitoring
and issue resolution; and good training.</p></li>
<li><p>Many key process areas at all maturity levels of the CMM for software
focus directly on project management.</p></li>
</ul>
