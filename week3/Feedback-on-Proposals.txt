General Feedback:

Many of the proposals...

- lack of clear background info or references
- proposal is too brief, lacks description of features, or poorly written
- the desired product is also vague (lack of clarity on stakeholder wants)
- very limited set of features (scope). They could be implemented by 1 person.
- several proposals are poorly written. Basic punctuation and grammar
  errors you should have corrected. Shows lack of review or proof-reading.

== Bookren - CONDITIONALY APPROVE WITH CHANGES
Scope/complexity is too limited. OK if expand to a) match
features in Generic Ecommerce, b) allow anyone to lend/share books.
See below.

Some of the "Major Features" aren't features, they are just variations
on a use case.
I may allow this project if you can expand the features and scope.
Revise it to (say) "Book Buddy". 
Features:
 * both individuals and shops can offer books
 * books can be for sharing, rent, or sale.
 * when a user searches for a book, only books that he could possibly rent, borrow,
   or buy are shown.  That is, if a supplier only rents/loans/sells to "friends"
   or users with a good reputation, and this user doesn't qualify, then he doesn't
   see books that he doesn't qualify for.
 * can search by proximity, so only suppliers within a given distance of your
   location are shown
 * the supplier can offer books to anyone or just to "friends" or users with good reputation
 * use Facebook and Google to discover friends
 * user reputation: how reliable is the user for returning books,
   and taking care of borrowed books?  Book suppliers can rate a user they have rented to.
 * provide inventory tracking (books in stock, rented, loaned out, or sold)
 * provide rental/loan tracking with due date notification
 * REQUIRED: automatic lookup of book details based on ISBN or partial book title. 
   User inputs ISBN number or part of title and system fetches book information. 
   (This will require using a web service.)
 * Software must provide a documented way for adding new book lookup services
   without modifying the existing application.  Just change a configuration value.

== Berlem Commart - CONDITIONALLY APPROVE: ok if scope/features are expanded to
include all requirements in Generic E-commerce.

 Basic e-commerce app for buying a "build to order" computer.
 Proposal is OK but needs more e-commerce features, as in Generic E-Commerce.
 English is OK.


== Social Network -?
 Manatsawin
 Proposal OK.
 English is good.
 It would be nice to have a social network that facilitated something *other*
 than posting conversations, photos, and chatting. It would also be nice to
 not re-invent services, like photo sharing, if you can adapt or embed an
 existing service in your application.
 Can fitness or weight management be a social activity? (counciling and peer
 support).

== Shoppa - this is quite similar to "Market" proposal. Combine them.

Thanyaboon Tovorapan 	5610546745
Varis Kritpolchai 		5610546770
Not many features in proposal.
Writing is OK.  I don't see why need "Algorithm design" skill
(everyone should know basic algorithms).

== Market - online marketplace for mutiple stores.
A standard e-commerce app with multiple stores and location information,
so a customer can choose the closest or preffered store from among those
with his product.


== HomeWork (Home Workout) - NOT APPROVED due to poor proposal
Muninthorn Thongnuch 5610545765
Runyasak Chaengnaimuang 5610545781
I think the complexity/scope is too small.
Proposal is too brief, and not many requirements.
Don't use Q&A style writing in proposal.

== Trainer+ - NOT APPROVED

Thanachote		Visetsuthimont	5610545692
Thanaphon		Ketsin			5610546729

Project needs 2 "image, infographic designers" and 2 domain experts:
too many non-Software Engineering personnel for this course.
Getting and inputting enough data to make this useful will be
significant work, but not really helpful for learning to apply software process.
Maybe too much research effort.
Original proposal had many grammar and some logic errors; I corrected some.  
Successful weight loss program is not as simple as calorie counting 
(which doesn't work in long term). 
Successful health improvement based on diet is even more complex.
Refs: "Healthy for Life" by Dr. Ray Strand, 
      "Eat Right, Live Longer" by Dr. Neal Bernand.  
Search "glycemic load".

== Manga.read - NOT APPROVED
Jiratchaya	Intaragumhaeng	5610546702
not sure about the complexity of this one. An OOP student
wrote a Manga reader that uses RSS feed and caches manga content, 
and did it in 2 weeks without a plan.

== Stock Trading - NOT APPROVED, due to need for 3 knowledge engineer and too much
knowledge research.
Nut Kaewnak 5610545676
Supason Kotanut 5610546800
Piyaphat Tulakoop 5610545731

A good project for KM or Machine Learning but not this course.
The vision of product and how it will be used are not clear.
Problem getting data other than price quotes.
how will you get the real-time quotes and 56.1 filings?
Managing stock data and creating charts is moderate complexity,
but generating non-trivial stock trading rules is a research project.
How will user create his own rules?  Some apps (like ThinkOrSwim) have
their own language for this, but its not easy.

== Cristina Cuisine - NOT APPROVED, but nicely written proposal
Chinnaporn 	Soonue 			5610546231
Chonnipa 	Kittisiriprasert 		5610546222

I think its too simple. The complexity is mostly
related to recipe database.  
Proposal is very well written, except some grammar
and punctuation errors. "Other Requirements" section
has poor content, though.  Many of them are either
obvious ("vulnerability of database must be protected")
or redundant. 

== Food For Fun - NOT APPROVED. Too simple and proposal in insufficient.
Don't use Q&A style for things I asked in written proposal.

5410546393	Akkarawit	Piyawin

== Bike - NOT APPROVED based on poor writing and personnel requirements.
Niti			Petcharatmora	5610545013
Perawith		Jarunithi		5610546281
Nathas		Yingsukamol	5610546753

Major features are vague.  
Not clear about the complexity or what is successful product. 
Too many non-developers: 3 image/infographic designer, 2 domain expert,
1 product owner. 
Proposal is poorly written.  Looks like you didn't proof-read it.

== Bike for Mor - NOT APPROVED
Nichamon	Han-idhikul		5610545684
Vasupol	Chatmethakul		5610546788
This is useful but has been done several times already (senior projects).  
Problems are: a) depends too much on hardware integration,
b) proposal is too brief, just 1.5 pages with 3 vague features.
Don't use Q&A style in written proposal for standard items,
e.g. "How many people does this project require?".
 
== Come To Me - NOT APPROVED
Nara Surawit , 
Wuttipong Khemphetjetsada
Scope/complexity is too limited. 
Proposal is not well written. Don't use Q&A writing style.
