2. Describe a good quality of PPQA. (3, good question but poor answer and poor ref.)

	PPQA should be reliable and careful because PPQA have to check defect and review code. [Wrong: not PPQA's job to review code.] If PPQA not detect problem early,
	it will effect to the whole project. Project may take longer time to finish. PPQA also have to be able to use good [E]english because
	PPQA have to do some documents and check every document that the details is[are] complete and the gramma[r] is correct.

3. The importance of coding standard? [not a sentence] (4, incomplete answer)
