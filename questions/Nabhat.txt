1. What is the difference between an Iterative model and the Waterfall model? (4)

	Ans: Waterfall Model is a flow based model, when we pass each phase we can not go back to that phase again [wrong], so if there is any change in requirements, we cannot make any changes. On the other hand, Iterative Model can always come back to previous phases, and make the changes.
