<h2>Work for Oct 6</h2>
<p>
	For this week there's only minor process-related work.
	Teams should continue using the practices you have defined already,
	and focus your effort on design, development, and testing.
</p>
<p>
  As a check, look at the work you assign for this week,
	and compaare how much effort (time) is related to product and how much
	is process "overhead".  Most of the effort should be product-related.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
	Update your estimated effort, schedule, and milestones based on your revised SRS.
	You may have already done this.
</li>
<li>
	Establish at least 1 milestone for this week (and do this each week).
	Milestones are related to progress of the product, not process work.
</li>
<li>
	Team should agree on how defects will be recorded and tracked,
	and include this in one of your plans (QA plan, SDP, and/or CM plan).
	After a defect is "fixed" it should be reviewed and tested before closing it.
	<br/>
	Defects found during testing and walk-throughs should be recorded;
	defects a programmer finds himself during unit testing are optional.
</li>
<li>
	Create some form of EV chart showing estimated and actual EV versus time.
	Its a useful visual aid for tracking your progress.
</ol>
