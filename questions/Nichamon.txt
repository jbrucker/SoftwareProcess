Question 1

High quality software can be defined as the software with as few defects as possible. 
Describe the definition of defect, when the defect is injected in the project and 
how to remove the defect to increase quality of software.

Answer

Defect is something that causes the software to be inconsistent with the requirements or customer needs.

During working on the project, defect can be injected at any stage: 
	- requirements specification
	- high level design
	- detailed design
	- coding

The defect removal is quality control activities which include:
	- Review: requirements, document, design, code
	- Testing: unit, integration, system, acceptance

Question 2

The group review process is divided into 4 stages: planning, overview and preparation, group review meeting,
and rework and follow-up. Describe short explanation of the activities in each of stages. 

Answer

	Planning
This phase is to select the group review team and moderator, and to schedule review meeting. 

	Overview and preparation
Reviewers individually review the work product by using checklists, guidelines or standards. 
Reviewers take notes if they find defects.

	Group review meeting
The reviewers or readers inspect work product line by line. If they find any issue or defect, 
the team will discuss that they agree or disagree with it. The author clarifies the issue and then the issue or defect is recorded.
	
	Rework and follow-up
The author rework or redo the correct work product. The author together with moderator reviews the final work product.
