PSP Section 7.5 "Earned Value":

"Note that there is no partial credit for partially completed tasks.
The earned value credit is given only when the task is completed.
If the task is half done, it contributes nothing."

This is the most common way of measuring earned value.

However, some references on the web mention conventions for
assigning EV to partially completed work. The problem is in
aligning EV with the actual "percentage done".
