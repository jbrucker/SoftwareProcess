2.Describe each phases of RUP
Answer   Inception: Understand what to build

   Construction: Build it
   Transition: Validate solution

3.Explain kinds of tests and give example of test case format
Answer   Black-box Testing
			System is viewed as a black box. You test inputs and outputs (or responses), based on what the system should do.Should means the requirements specification.
   		White-box Testing
			Tests based on knowledge of the source code, and can directly exercise the API. The aim of these tests is cover as much of the source code as possible, including all possible flows.

   		The general format:
			Verify: what you want to test 
			Using: tools, environment, url 
			With: conditions and data 
			To: what is to be done, shown, or returned

4.Give examples of software development model and explain (2)
Answer	Waterfall model:
			This is the oldest model. It represents sequence of stages; output of one stage becomes input of others. [this is true of every process]
		Spiral Model:
			This is improved version of waterfall model. Here we have scope to reiterate and go back to the earlier stages number of times as project progresses.
[So do iterative processes, what is special about Spiral Model?]
		Prototyping Model
			In this model, we develop prototype which acts like a final product. Once prototype is approved, then the actual development starts.
[Waterfall can also include a prototype! See Royce's original paper.]
		Incremental Model
			In this model, the product is divided into sections and each section of the product are created and tested separately. [Wrong: product isn't divided into "sections".
Iteration is more commonly based on refining the arcitecture and implementing features]
