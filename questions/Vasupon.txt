QUESTION 1:

WHAT IS A WALK THROUGH AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO PPQA? (5)

A walk through is an informal code review between peers where the programmer
guides any members of the development team through their software product. This
is important to PPQA because it allows them to specifically check for coding 
standards and correctly understand the code for evaluation.

QUESTION 2:

WHAT IS THE PPQA ROLE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF RUP? (5)

During the early stages there is no coding yet so there is no process to evaluate.
In this time the PPQA must work with other roles to establish the coding standard,
quality assurance plan, and processes that will be used in the elaboration phase 
and beyond.

QUESTION 3:

Pick the best answer: 
THE PROGRAMMERS ULTIMATELY DETERMINE WHICH FEATURES TO DO FIRST JUDGING FROM 
THE IMPORTANCE GIVEN BY THE CUSTOMER WHILE DISREGARDING THE RISK. (5)

1. False, the RUP process is risk-driven when it comes to the iterations, so 
programmers ultimately determines the features through estimated risks.
2. True, the customer determines the iterations so they can see the early product
with the features as soon as possible.
3. False, the features are determined solely based on time.
4. False, the programmers will do what they feel like should be done first based
on experience.

QUESTION 4:

Pick the INCORRECT answer:
WHICH OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIFFICULTY OF ESTIMATING
PROJECT SIZE? (5)

1. Invisibility — Progress isn’t as visible as it is when building a bridge or a factory.
2. Complexity — Software development seems to be inherently more complex than other 
engineering processes. 
3. Marketability — Software has to be marketable, so it has to be analyze for the market
size
4. Flexibility — Software is inherently easy to change.
