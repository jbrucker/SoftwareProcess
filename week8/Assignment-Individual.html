<h2>Individual Assignment on Software Process Knowledge</h2>
<p>
	Create 4 questions with answers for process-related knowledge 
    that software engineering students (and software engineers) should know.
    Questions can be anything related to software development process,
    including specific practices, process areas, and goals.
    <br/>
    <b>At least 2</b> of the questions should be related to your <b>role</b>
    on the class team project. If you have two roles, such as developer and CM,
    then 2 questions should be related to your non-developer role such as CM.
</p>
<p>
	The other two questions can be any process-related knowledge that
	is useful or important for a software engineering to know.
</p>
<p>
    Guidelines for questions and answers:
	<ol>
	<li>
		Questions don't need to be complicated, but should be something
		that demonstrates understanding of good software process, practices,
        and/or good project management.
	</li>
	<li>
		A question can be given as a scenario, asking what to do in a given
		project context or to analyse some context.
	</li>
    <li>
        The question should be answerable in at most 1-2 paragraphs;
        short answers are better.
        The question should be such that an answer can be objectively 
        evaluated as correct or not.
	<li>
		For each question, include your answer. 
		You may provide additional explanation of the answer.
	</li>
	<li>
		For each question provide at least one <b>reference</b> for additional information.
		Reference can be a URL, an article, or a book.  For articles and books,
		state precisely where to find the information, e.g.
		<blockquote>
		Jalote, <em>Software Project Management in Practice</em>, section 6.3.
		</blockquote> 
	</li>
	<li>
		Submit questions and answers in a file.
        If your question and answer are plain text, use plain text file.
        If you need some formatting, use HTML or Markdown, but no CSS or Javascript.
        <br/>
        You can include images for diagrams.
	</li>
    <li>
        Your questions, answers, and references will be posted online for the entire 
        class to study.
    <li>
    <li>
        Your score will be based on the quality of the question and answer,
        its relevance to practice software process knowledge, and correct use of English.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
Upload a file or files for your questions to LMS.ku.ac.th (week 8).
Include your name in each file (except images).
