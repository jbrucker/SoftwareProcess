<h2>Project Proposal</h2>

<p>
Individually or with a group of up to 4 people, create a proposal
for a software project for this course.
The project you work on may not be the one you propose,
and the team may not include everyone writing a proposal.
The instructor will choose which project proposals to implement and team assignments.
</p>

<h3>Guidelines for Project</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Can be completed in one semester by a team of 5-9 students.  
For a larger team, the project will be divided into components.
</li>
<li>
Architecture consists of at least 2 components that can be developed simultaneously
by a few members of the team, and/or uses component(s) produced by a different team.
This isn't a <em>requirement</em>, but a desirable characteristic.
</li>
<li>
Project should not be trivial, but not too hard, either.
The emphasis is on applying software process practices to your work
rather than stretching the limits of your technical skills.
</li>
<li>
Requires some domain-specific knowledge, but not so much that it becomes mainly a research project.
</li>
<li>
The project can be an enhancement of an existing software product.
</li>
<li>
The project can be related to a project you must do for another course,
which will give you more time to devote to it.
In this case, you must follow the process(es) of this course and meet
the deadlines for iterations/deliverables from both courses.
<p>
If your project is related to another course, please discuss it with me.
</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Project Proposal</h3>

Create a project proposal by next week.
The proposal should include:
<ol>
<li>
General description of your proposed project.
</li><li>
Background, Opportunity, and Need.  As in the Vision Templete from SS&amp;D.
<ul>
	<li> Why do you want to do this project?  Is it related to work for another course?
</li></ul>
</li><li>
Vision of the Solution
	<ul>
	  <li>More detailed description of your product. Include images where appropriate.
(A <em>Vision</em> should be <em>visual</em>.)
	  </li><li>Major features you will produce.
	  </li><li>Dependencies.  Does it use results of another project?  Use existing services?
	</li></ul>
</li><li>
Resources.
	<ul>
	  <li>How many people does this project need?
	  </li><li>What <em>skills</em> does this project team require?
	</li>
        </ul>
</li>
<li>
External dependencies, if any.
</li>
</ol>


<h3>What to Submit</h3>
<ol>
<li>A <b>printed copy</b> in class next week.  If multiple people work on the
proposal, just submit one copy with all your names in it.
</li><li>Online document in Google Docs.
	<ul>
	<li>Grant read/write access to jebrucker@gmail.com, so I can comment on it.
